This Terraform code sets up various AWS resources to monitor AWS IAM events and sends alerts to an email when a new access key is created. The code sets up:

    AWS CloudTrail: to log all AWS API calls, including IAM events. The logs are stored in an S3 bucket.

    AWS CloudWatch Event Rule: to trigger an event whenever a new IAM access key is created.

    AWS CloudWatch Event Target: to send the triggered event to a Lambda function.

    SNS Topic: to subscribe to the alerts.

    S3 Bucket: to store the CloudTrail logs and the alert emails.

    Lambda Function: to receive the CloudWatch event and send out an email through SNS.

    IAM Role: to grant the necessary permissions to the Lambda function.
